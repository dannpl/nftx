# NFTX

### Scope of Work
Develop a program using Anchor that mints a collection of NFTs. Create a vault to lock these NFTs, where the rent for locking is returned to the protocol rather than the user. This project must include storage and retrieval of images with appropriate metadata. Additionally, create a swap program using Native Rust or Anchor that allows users to exchange $SOL for NFTs. This program should perform all necessary checks, use a vault, and enable swapping between $SOL and NFTs. Here's the checklist:

- Mint a collection of NFTs using Anchor.

- Develop a vault system to lock NFTs, where rental fees are returned to the protocol.

- Ensure image storage and retrieval are functional and metadata is appropriately assigned.

- Create a swap program using Native Rust or Anchor that allows users to exchange $SOL for NFTs.
